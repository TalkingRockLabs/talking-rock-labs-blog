## Our Mission

Talking Rock Labs is a collaborative security research project focused on vulnerability research, tool development, and advancing offensive security tradecraft in our technical focus areas: OT/IoT/SCADA exploitation, applications of RF for offsec, evasive offensive operations, physical security, and secure communications. Our objective is accurate, useful, transparent, and accessible research in these areas.

## What We Do

We produce and disseminate research to the larger security community. This work spans multiple areas of security research:

* **Offensive Security Research** - Developing and documenting novel attack techniques and methodologies
* **Security Tool Development** - Building open-source tools for penetration testing and red teaming
* **Vulnerability Research** - Discovering and responsibly disclosing security vulnerabilities
* **Knowledge Sharing** - Publishing detailed technical writeups, tutorials, and research findings
* **Community Engagement** - Contributing to the broader security community through collaboration and education

## Research Areas

Our current research interests include:

* Red Team Operations & Adversary Simulation
* Penetration Testing Methodologies
* Malware Development & Analysis
* Active Directory Security
* Evasion Techniques & Defensive Countermeasures
* Cloud Security
* Container & Kubernetes Security
* Exploit Development
* Post-Exploitation Techniques

## Ethics & Responsible Disclosure

Talking Rock Labs is committed to ethical security research:

* All research and tools are developed with the intent of improving security, not enabling malicious activity
* We follow responsible disclosure practices for any vulnerabilities discovered
* Our work is intended for authorized security testing, defensive security improvements, and educational purposes
* We respect all readers and strive to make our content accessible and valuable to the security community

## Get Involved

We welcome collaboration from security researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts. Whether you're interested in contributing research, sharing tools, or simply learning from our work, we encourage you to engage with our content and reach out.

## Acknowledgments

This research initiative builds upon the individual work and experiences of its contributors, including content previously published on personal blogs and platforms, and the use of open-source tools. We're grateful to the broader security community for the knowledge sharing and collaboration that makes this work possible.
